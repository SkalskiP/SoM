# Set-of-Mark (SoM)

## 👋 hello

This is a non-official (and probably much worse) implementation of the Set-of-Mark 
(SoM) tools described in the paper ["Set-of-Mark Prompting Unleashes Extraordinary 
Visual Grounding in GPT-4V"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11441) by Jianwei Yang, Hao 
Zhang, Feng Li, Xueyan Zou, Chunyuan Li, Jianfeng Gao.

## 🛠️ how it works?

TODO

## 📍 roadmap

- [ ] Wrap up the current SoM implementation in the Gradio app.
